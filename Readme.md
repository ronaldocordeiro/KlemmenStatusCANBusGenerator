Arduino-based code to generate tha CANBus message Klemmen_Status_01, used in VAG (VW Group) cars to inform the status of electrical terminals to the electronic modules connected to the CANBus. Most electronic modules (ECUs) require Klemme (Terminal) 15 ON in order to "wake up" and start responding to CANbus communication. This code sends Klemmen_Status_01 with both Klemme_15 and Klemme_S bits activated, as when the car's ignition is on, so electronic modules connected to it can be tested on a workbench, without the need to be installed in a car.

Circuit requires a MCP2515 based CANBus shield connected to the Arduino board through SCI.
